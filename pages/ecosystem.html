                                The data that is collected is free from fraud. That is, the data is collected from targeted providers who have provided their data honestly. For example, requesters expect their surveys to be answered truthfully by their target demographic, and not say, a bot.

                                Requesters should be able to get answers to their questions quickly without worrying about the details of how to reach their target demographic. By using smart contracts, which execute transactions between anonymous parties, users will be able to sell their data without disclosing their identity, only broad demographic information.
